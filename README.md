## MySB Portal

To access services installed on your new server, point your browser to the following address (MySB portal):
```
https://<Server IP or Server Name>:<https NginX port>/
```

###### Main user and normal users
	* Users can change their password.
	* Users can change their IP addresses for authorized connection (dynamic DNS included).

###### Normal users only
	* Direct access to the various services installed (ruTorrent, Cabox-Light, Seedbox-Manager).
	
###### Main user only
	* Direct access to the various services installed, like normal users plus others services (Webmin, Logs, Renting Infos, SMTP).
	* Manage trackers list.
	* Manage blocklists (rTorrent and PeerGuardian).

## Seedbox-Manager

The seedbox web-manager application is an interface to restart a rtorrent user session.

Author: backtoback (c) & Magicalex (php) & hydrog3n (php).
```
https://github.com/Magicalex/seedbox-manager/
```

## Cakebox-Light

Cakebox is a small web app written with AngularJS and Silex, in order to list directories and watch video files for a specified directory.

Author: MardamBeyK & Tuxity.
```
https://github.com/Cakebox/Cakebox-light
```

## BlockList
BlockList usage (optionnal), PeerGuardian or directly via rTorrent.
Depending on your system, it is possible to use: 

#### PeerGuardian

	* By default, some list are activated. Check this list in MySB portal.
	* All trackers listed with ruTorrent are available but are inactive. You can add more or activate it via MySB portal.

###### NOTE 1: 	Do not try to add your rtorrents ports in the list of incoming ports allowed in PeerGuardian (pglcmd.conf) !!!
###### 			Using PeerGuardian will not have much sense ...
###### 			Rather prefer permission trackers via the "allow.p2p" PeerGuardian file. To do this, use MySB portal.
###### 			If PeerGuardian failed to start, rTorrent blocklists are used instead.
###### NOTE 2:	Do not activate all trackers, but only these needed.

OR

#### rTorrent (with ipv4_filter.load)

	* By default, some list are activated. Check this list in MySB portal.
	* Once the lists are selected, a common file containing all the lists will be generated and copied for each user.

###### NOTE:	Beware, if you do not have enough memory, too much list activ√©e will make your system slower, especially if you have multiple users!

## OpenVPN

To use your VPN you will need a VPN client compatible with [OpenVPN](http://openvpn.net/index.php?option=com_content&id=357), necessary files to configure your connection are in this link in your box:
```
http://<Server IP or Server Name>:<https NginX port>/?user/openvpn-config-file.html` and use it in any OpenVPN client.
```
#### For OpenVZ, you must validate the prerequisites on this page first. Otherwise, OpenVPN will not be functional.
```
https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs/admin-guides/186-how-to-run-access-server-on-a-vps-container.html
```
##### NFS and Samba share with OpenVPN
For NFS, you can mount the '/home/<username>/rtorrent' like that. The IP address can be different depending on the OpenVPN configuration that you have selected.
```
mount -t nfs [10.0.0.1|10.0.1.1]:/home/<username>/rtorrent <mount_dir> -o  -o vers=3
```
For Samba, you can mount the '/home/<username>' like that. The IP address can be different depending on the OpenVPN configuration that you have selected.
```
mount - <mount_dir> -t cifs -o noatime,nodiratime,UNC=//[10.0.0.1|10.0.1.1]/<username>,username=<username>,password=<your_password>
```

## DNScrypt-proxy
By default, DNScrypt-proxy will use OpenDNS resolver (dnscrypt.eu-dk). 
The full list of DNScrypt resolvers is available at: https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv 

It is possible to change the resolver name via MySB portal OR using using the following command:
```
dnscrypt-proxy service restart <resolver_name>
```

To clean Bind cache, just restart BIND service.
```
service bind9 restart
```

###### IMPORTANT: With OpenVZ container, to complete the installation of DNScrypt-proxy, you must replace your existing DNS config (/etc/resolv.conf), by the loopback address.
###### IMPORTANT: It's necessary to make the change via the host (eg Proxmox), otherwise you will lose your configuration on next reboot. You must replace yours nameserver by 'nameserver 127.0.0.1' (/etc/resolv.conf).


## SMTP authentification
If you want to use GMAIL provider, maybe should you read this for authorize connexion to your account by your server.
```
https://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha
```

## Plex Media Server
To complete the Plex Media Server configuration, an excellent tutorial is available here:
```
http://mondedie.fr/viewtopic.php?id=5732
```

## Supported and tested servers

#### Debian 7 - x86_64 (Wheezy)

	--> Tested on Online.net with "DEDIBOX¬Æ SC GEN2" and "DEDIBOX¬Æ XC"
	--> Tested on OpenVZ Container with ProxMox, work fine ! (read comment in top of this page)
	--> Tested on OVH with "Kimsufi"
  
#### Ubuntu or older Debian may worked, but not tested...
